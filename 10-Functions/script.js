// How Passing Arguments Works: Value vs Reference

  }
}

// checkIn(flight, fernando);
// console.log(flight); // primitive => flightNum only contains a copy and not the original value. flightNum = flight; flighNum is a completely different variable
// console.log(fernando); // reference type (object), we are really copying the reference to that object in the memory heap. is the same as doing const passenger = jonas; but they both point to the same object in memory.
// we have be aware of this characteristic since it can be a font of many problems, especially when working with many developers
// JS only passes by value, never by reference. We can pass the reference value but never BY reference. 

// First-Class and Higher-Order Functions
// functions are just another type of objects, and since objects are values, functions are simply values. because of this we can store them in variables or proporties
// first-class functions are only a feature that states functions are simply values 
// we can pass functions as arguments to OTHER functions, return functions from functions and call methods on functions - function methods like bind
// Higher-Order functions are functions that receive other functions AND/OR that return a new function
// btnClose.addEventListener('click', greet) - greet is the callback function while addEventListener is the higher-order one
